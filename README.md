# 🤟 Sign Language to Voice and Text Translator

This mobile application translates **sign language gestures** into **text** and **voice output** using advanced AI and computer vision techniques. The solution aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by offering real-time interpretation using a mobile device.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project leverages cutting-edge deep learning models and computer vision to:

- Capture real-time hand gestures via a camera
- Recognize and interpret signs using a GRU-based model
- Translate the signs into text
- Convert the recognized text to human-like voice using TTS

Developed as a part of our Artificial Intelligence coursework to apply theoretical knowledge in a real-world assistive technology solution.
